# word-correction-software

Project proposed by the Algorithms and Programming: Linear Data Structures course at Unisinos

### You are tired of writing wrong, so you decided to build a word correction software to help you with your e-mails.

#### This program should read the entire text, word by word, and compare with some defined words in the palavras.txt file
 * If the word exist in the file, it's correct. If not, it's incorrect

#### This program also:
* Request user name
* Allows user to enter any text (the end of the text it's when the user presses  enter)
* Analyze the words entered by the user, ignoring all capitals and lower case letters and all periods and commas (considering only words without accents)
* Inform the user (on the screen) of all the mistakes he made in that text
* Ask the user if he wants to continue or quit
* Save a "USERNAME.txt" file
